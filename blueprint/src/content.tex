\begin{definition}[\texttt{TB}]
    \label{def:TB}
    The theory \texttt{TB} comprises all axioms of \texttt{PAT}, that is, of Peano arithmetic formulated in $\mathcal{L}_T$ including all instances of the induction schema with the truth predicate. Moreover all sentences of the form $T\ulcorner\varphi\urcorner$ are axioms of the theory where $\varphi$ is a sentence of the language of $\mathcal{L}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:tb-cons}
    % \lean{[the right reference]}
    \texttt{TB} is conservative over \texttt{PA}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} \uses{def:TB} We show how to transform any given \texttt{TB}-proof of an arithmetical formula into a \texttt{PA}-proof of the same formula. 

\end{proof}
